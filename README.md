# Quality-Data-Storage

(Quality Data Storage of e-documentation spaice for production companies)

## Motivation:
For our team to solve a real-life problem is very exciting.

## So we build this project because
- we like the idea of the Quality Data Storage;
- we are super excited to build our first full-stuck App.

## We are happy to present our vision to solve a lot of problems and makes live easeir.
The inspiration behind this project was to significantly enhance the way companies save and organize their documents by transitioning from traditional paper-based methods to a more streamlined electronic format. When relying on pen and paper, a range of issues can arise that hinder efficiency and accuracy. For instance, documents can easily be misplaced, leading to potential loss of critical information. Important details might be misspelled, which could cause misunderstandings or errors. Additionally, physical papers are susceptible to damage, whether through spills, tears, or general wear and tear, making them less reliable over time. Furthermore, managing a large volume of physical documents becomes increasingly cumbersome, with the need to track and sort through numerous papers to find specific pieces of information. Retrieving past information on a product, client, or project is particularly challenging when dealing with physical documents. The process of sifting through stacks or files can be time-consuming and prone to error, slowing down productivity and potentially causing delays in decision-making. This is where our solution, Quality Data Storage, becomes invaluable.

We developed this innovative system to address these challenges by converting physical documents into electronic files and securely storing them in a digital database. 

With Quality Data Storage, companies can seamlessly digitize their paperwork, allowing for quick and easy access to essential information. The electronic format not only helps in organizing documents more effectively but also supports advanced search and retrieval functions, making it straightforward to locate specific data swiftly. This transition to digital documentation ensures that companies can manage their information with greater efficiency, reduce the risk of errors and data loss, and eliminate the myriad complications associated with handling physical files. By embracing this technology, businesses can achieve a higher level of operational efficiency, enhanced accuracy, and a more organized approach to managing their critical documents.

## We learned a process of a full-stuck WebApp developing.
We learned how to use 
- SQL
- data base intergration
- how the riughting flow worked,
- MVS arcutecture helped us devid the taskes
- make the code flow more better. 

## Instalation:
- To use this data storage you would use this url to access it:  https://quality-data-storage.onrender.com/
  For this version of the project an access is expires on Augest 28th, 2024
  
## Usage:
After this WebApp adjusted by a Company needs then:
1. Simply open this webpp in any browser;
2. As administrator you can add new operators, give them an access to macines
3. Operator loges in and then will see only macines he/she has access to
4. Operator will choose the machine for todays
5. Operator will get an list of samples that are specife for this machine and a form to perform the results of samples he/she executed on the machine
6. from the home page you can acces to the page with audit info (results of samples). As for now this access is available for any employee. But in our plans to make it optional.

## This WebApp is still under developing
![Now this WebPage as it looks like](https://github.com/MarynaMartseniuk/Quality-Data-Storage/blob/main/public/assets/home-page.jpg/)

Our plans:
1. work on appearance
2. add more functionality:
  - add a new operator,
  - ability to change oparators data,
  - provide an operator with its profile page (with all personal info and resonal accesses to prodaction: machines, samples, and to HR options (times-chasing, payments, days off ect)),
  - provide an administrators with their personal pages and accesses depend on company requirements
  - rganize an e-documentation archive and access to it with the diferent level of access
